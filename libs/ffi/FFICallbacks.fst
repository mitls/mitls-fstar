(* under the covers, recv invokes String.Substring, which may throw an exception
   due to invalid parameters.  But the recv codepath never does that.  However,
   The F* compiler does not know that.  So implement FFI recv in ML to avoid
   exposing the String.Substring call to effects checking.  Same as
   Platform.Tcp.recv *)
