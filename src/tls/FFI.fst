module FFI

// A thin layer on top of TLS, adapting a bit our main API:
// - for TCP send & receive, we use callbacks provided by the application
// - for output traffic, we send fragment and send the whole message at once
// - for client connects, we block until the connection is sucessfully established
//
// We rely on higher-order; to be reconsidered once we compile to C/C++.

// TODO: guarantee (by typing) that we don't do stdio, and don't throw
//       exceptions, notably for incomplete pattern matching
