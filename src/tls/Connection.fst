(*
   Aiming to prove that sending a message preserves the
   invariant for all the epochs in a connection.

   A connection c encapsulates the state machine of a connection.
   It contains within an hs, the handshake state machine.

   The hs.log field is a ref to a seq of epochs all residing in
   regions with the same parent region.

   Each epoch is an (h, r, w) triple,
     where the r:StatefulLHAE.reader
               w:StatefulLHAE.writer
     are each one end of a key pair (their peers are in a some other connection).
     
     The h field is the state of the handshake state machine and is
     irrelevant for this framing lemma.

   In the lemma below, we modify the writer of epoch j
   and aim to show that the invariant of some arbitrary k is preserved.
   
   Later, we generalize over k, using the ghost_lemma combinator to introduce the quantifier.
