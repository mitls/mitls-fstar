(* extractMS is internal and extracts entropy from both rsapms and dhpms bytes 

   Intuitively (and informally) we require extractMS to be a computational 
   randomness extractor for both of the distributions generated by genRSA and 
   sampleDH, i.e. we require that 

   PRF.sample si ~_C extractMS si genRSA pk cv         //for related si and pk cv
   PRF.sample si ~_C extractMS si sampleDH p g gx gy   //for related si and p g gx gy

   In reality honest clients and servers can be tricked by an active adversary 
   to run different and multiple extraction algorithms on the same pms and 
   related client server randomness. We call this an agile extractor, following:
   http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.187.6929&rep=rep1&type=pdf

   si contains potentially random values csrands generated by the client and the server. 
   If we do not want to rely on these values being random we require deterministic extraction.

   If we use them as seeds there may be some relations to non-malleable extractors:
   https://www.cs.nyu.edu/~dodis/ps/it-aka.pdf,
   we are however in the computational setting.

(* Idealization strategy: to guarantee that in ideal world 
   mastersecrets (ms) are completely random extract samples 
   a ms at random when called first on arguments such that 
   'msi si' is not yet in the log. 
    
   When called on arguments that result in the same values 
   again, the corresponding master secret is retrieved from 
   a secret log. 

   This is done only for pms for which safeCRE si is true.
   Note that in this way many idealized master secrets can 
   be derived from the same pms. *)
