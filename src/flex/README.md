# FlexTLS

## Work in progress

   - Integrate TLS 1.3

   - Include new algorithms

   - Remove the SmackTLS part in favor of the JS version

## Open problems
   
   - Can we integrate our private F* crypto library ?
   
   - Can we prove the security of individual FlexTLS scenarios ?

   - Can we generate single scenario implementations ?
