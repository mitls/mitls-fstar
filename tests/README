Regression tests for miTLS

**** Running ****

Typically, invoking 'make' will do.

This will create temporary certificates and install them into the Windows
certificate store (or the Mono emulation), if they don't already exist.
Then, the test suite will be ran.

The test suite is a python script that requires the pythonw executable,
version 2.7 (it won't work with python 3).
On Unix distributions, installing the python package is usually all you
need to do.
On Mac OS X, python should be already installed. Alternative versions can
be obtained via brew.
On Windows, you need the cygwin environment to run 'make'; however, you
need the native Windows python distribution; python as provided by
cygwin won't do. So, install python on Windows, then make sure the
C:/Python27/pythonw.exe executable is in your cygwin path (e.g. by
adding C:/Python27 to your Windows Path environment variable).

After some time, the temporary certificates expire, at which points all
tests start failing. Run 'make clean' to remove all the temporary
certificates.

**** Configuring testing scenarios ****

The test suite reads its configuration from the test-suite.ini file.
You can change its content to alter the test suite. (Yes, we should
give more instructions on the contents of this file.)
